* [Bugfix] Node was not able to get new peers other than the known ones under some configurations

2.2.0
---------

2.1.0
---------
* Added support for forger's connections prioritization

  * Optimization of lookup strategy in modifiersCache
  * Preserve the order of block during synchronization
* Added option to force only connecting to known peers
* Fixes/Improvements on the way the SyncTracker handles the internal statuses maps

2.0.3
---------
* Fix in the handshake process - start connecting to nodes only after the Synchronizer is initialized

* existing endpoints changes:
  * POST /peers/blacklist -> body {"address": String, "durationInMinutes": Int} (the durationInMinutes default value is 60)
  * POST /peers/connect -> body {"address": String}
* messages renaming:
  * RandomPeerExcluding → RandomPeerForConnectionExcluding
  * Blacklisted [NetworkController.message] → DisconnectFromAddress
* configuration changes:
  * maxIncomingConnections & maxOutgoingConnections in place of maxConnections
